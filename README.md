## Providing feedback


## Underlying web technology
The app is built using the open source version of [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/), which is a Python module for creating dashboard visualisations of data. It uses the [``dash-bootstrap-components`` library](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/) for some components. The map is created using map data from Mapbox, which is in turn uses data from Open Street Map.

The app also uses fonts from FontAwesome.
