In 1972 at Cabauw (06348) a 213 m high mast was specifically built for meteorological research to establish relations between the state of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), land surface conditions and the general weather situation for all seasons. The Cabauw mast is located in the western part of the Netherlands (51.971 \xB0 N, 4.927 \xB0E) in a polder 0.7 m below average sealevel. This site was chosen, because it is rather representative for this part of the Netherlands and because only minor landscape developments were planned in this region. However, significant changes are the removal of the trees along a road east of the mast in 1975, and the building of houses in the village of Lopik east of the mast in more recent years."

      The CWD navigates and organises the interdisciplinary research activities at RWTH Aachen University in the area of WT drive train systems. These research activities contain both fundamental scientific analyses and pre-competitive research and development projects.<br><br>

      The scientists of the seven institutes combined in the CWD that deal with the system technology of wind turbines will all work together in the same office building at the CWD. This will help to intensify the networking and the boost of innovations. The scientific and organisational responsibility for the planning, usage and operation of the WT system test rigs is taken by the directorate of the CWD which interdisciplinary consists of the directors of the seven institutes mentioned above. To transfer results the Conference for Wind Power Drives in Aachen, amongst others, provides a platform."

Research and development at Germany's first offshore wind farm generates experience and knowledge that advance the construction and further development of offshore wind energy. RAVE is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) and coordinated by the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy Systems (IWES).<br><br>

        In more than 35 research projects, more than 60 partners from science and industry have been working on a wide range of research questions since 2008. The topics range from ecological questions and the further development of plants and foundations to the optimization of operations. The financial support from the BMWK so far amounted to more than 120 million euros.
