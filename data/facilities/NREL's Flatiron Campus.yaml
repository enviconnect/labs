    quote: NREL's Flatirons Campus features state-of-the-art equipment and facilities
      that support fundamental wind energy research, technology development, experimentation,
      and validation of components and systems. More than a renewable energy research
      site, Flatirons Campus is also home to the National Wind Technology Center (NWTC).
      Since 1992, NWTC scientists and engineers have pioneered the advancement of
      wind energy technology. Using field validation sites, dynamometers, structural
      research facilities, and composites manufacturing and integrated energy systems
      facilities, NWTC researchers and industry partners pursue wind energy innovations
      to create a clean, sustainable energy future powered by reliable, low-cost wind
      energy.
