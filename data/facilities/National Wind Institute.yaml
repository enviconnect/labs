    quote: The National Wind Institute (NWI) has evolved from its traditional
      singular focus on wind hazards to three main research pillars of Energy Systems,
      Atmospheric Measurement & Simulation, and Wind Engineering. Though all three
      of these pillars focus on distinct issues, they also maintain common ground
      via cross cutting themes. All research seeks to benefit communities at micro
      and macro scales.
