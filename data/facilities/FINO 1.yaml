    description: A 101-m met tower and platform in the North Sea. Data are available for use.
    quote: The research platform FINO1 is located in the immediate vicinity of areas where wind farms are being built or are already in operation. The research funding of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) aims at reducing wind energy costs, economies of scale as well as more reliable operation of wind turbines. With the measurement data collected at FINO1, essential results are obtained for the optimization of offshore wind farms.
